# Hobbies & Interests

### Reading Books üìö
As an avid reader, I find solace in the pages of a good book. Fiction, non-fiction, or poetry, each genre opens up a new world of possibilities and perspectives.



### Debating and Model United Nations (MUN) üí¨
Engaging in debates and participating in Model United Nations conferences allows me to hone my public speaking skills and delve into global issues while advocating for change.



### Culinary Adventures üç≥
Cooking is not just a necessity but a creative outlet for me. Experimenting with flavors and techniques in the kitchen brings me joy and satisfaction.



### Writing and Reading Poetry ‚úç
Poetry is the language of the soul. Whether penning down my thoughts or immersing myself in the verses of renowned poets, poetry is a source of inspiration and introspection.
